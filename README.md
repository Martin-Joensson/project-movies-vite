# Movie Site Project
### The Problem

Started by scaffolding the components and pages we thought we needed according to the design inspiration. We fetched the data from the API. Decided to use useParams to pass some of the information between pages. Passed props to a movie details page when you press a poster. Decided to do different pages for different categories.

If we had more time, we would work on the loading animations. Maybe add more pages for the movies.
